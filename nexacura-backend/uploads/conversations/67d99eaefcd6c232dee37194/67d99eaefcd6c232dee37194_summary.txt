The user seems to be struggling with intense emotions, particularly after experiencing bullying at school. They express a desire to retaliate with violence, but I repeatedly encourage them to seek healthier coping mechanisms and alternative solutions for the situation. I also highlight the importance of their safety and well-being, offering support and suggesting they consider reaching out for professional help. Despite their initial resistance, I gently encourage them to express their feelings and share more about their experiences. It's evident they are feeling alone and overwhelmed, making it crucial to offer empathetic support and guidance.
